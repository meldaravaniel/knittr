##Introduction
So far this is mostly experimenting.  I have some ideas for some tiny websites I'd like to create, but have some more learning to do before they can happen.  For now, I'm running through the [Angular.js Tutorial](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js) on [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and adding little things to the index page as I go.

I already work with a lot of ng, css, html, and js at work, but I don't feel like I have a very good background in it, so this will be my space to learn more about how these work together.  Hurrah!
